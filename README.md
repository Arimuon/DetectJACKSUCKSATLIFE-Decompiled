# DetectJACKSUCKSATLIFE Decompiled

## Story:
I met the creator of this project many years ago (2020 ish) on Skycade in a sky base faction I owned, way before I started programming myself. I used the program quite often and it worked very well. Years later Im no longer in contact with the creator but was curious how the program worked, so I decided to decompile it. Enjoy!
